# Simple Calculator with C#

This is a simple calculator that will be updated as I learn more about C#. 
As of current, it is a terminal based program.

This calculator is based off of the C# tutorial by freeCodeCamp (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org), and will be adjusted and modified as I go along.
